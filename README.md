### [Coffee Ratios](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.davis6307/viz/Coffee-1/Sheet1)
Cup o' java, anyone?  Designed with the home barista in mind.  This chart is simple enough, but Excel didn't have the flexibility to allow me to create the chart that I needed. Believe me, I was surprised as you that this simple chart taxed its abilities.

Four dimensions in a single chart: 
- Strength of coffee
- Grams of coffee
- Water in Ounces
- Water in ML

### Coming soon: Methanol Water Freezing points
Keep your windshield washer fluid from freezing this winter.  Designed with the (wood) alcohol mixologist in mind.
